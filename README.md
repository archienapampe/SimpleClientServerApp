# SimpleClientServerApp


### Description
In a separate thread, the coffee machine connects to the server and displays a menu for placing an order. The user connects to the server and after placing the order sends the data. The data is processed on the server using the database, after which the order is sent to the user, and the coffee machine gives out the amount of the remaining order data. 
You can also view the customer order history at any time by opening the history.log file

### HOW TO
Use python version 3.8.0
1. First of all, run the server.py file to raise up the server and database
2. Then connect the coffee machine by running the coffeemachine.py file
3. You can now connect the client
